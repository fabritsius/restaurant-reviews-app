# Node modules for Restaurant Reviews Project

There is nothing bad in being dependent on some other Git Repository. At the same time, there is no reason to be dependent, when yo can be independent.

To comfort my own soul and for people who don't want `Node` and `npm` on their machine, I decided to create this branch with all necessary node modules for Restaurant Reviews Project.

### Usage

 1. Clone or copy [master branch](https://github.com/fabritsius/restaurant-reviews-app) of this repo;
 2. Clone or copy [this branch](https://github.com/fabritsius/restaurant-reviews-app/tree/node-modules);
 3. Add `node_modules` directory from this branch to the root of Restaurant Reviews Project;
 4. You are all set. You won't need `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files (you can delete both of them).

Thanks for your attension!
