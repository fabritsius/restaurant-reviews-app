#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Completed Stage 1

You can [check](https://github.com/fabritsius/mws-restaurant-stage-1) in what state was this project before. I decided not to enclude such code in this repository cause I'm afraid it may bring misfortune. In real life hopefully there is nothing even close to that level of crafted monstrosity.

I tried to preserve some design ideas from the original. And I even think it looks pleasant now.

### What it can do on my machine:

- Looks great with every screen size and ratio, brave disign choices were made;
- It Works Offline! Well... Kind of. Only pages that vere visited, which is still great for a website though;
- Images are responsive and are supposed to be responsive everywhere (some strange stuff happens in Chrome Mobile Emulator).
- Can be TAB-ed with ease. Sometimes not in order (I moved some parts to the end), but I think it is better this way but will reverse it if needed;
- I checked usability with ChromeVox and it seems to me it is reasonable, although I prefer the other way;
- You can use a Map for multiple purposes.

### Usage

There is no reason to use it apart from Maps (there is no backend currently), but just in case:

1. Copy my code via Git or manually;
2. Open copied directory in your terminal;
3. Use `python3 -m http.server 8000` to launch a server (you need python for that);
4. Go to `localhost:8000` to see the masterpeace.

Thanks for your attension!
